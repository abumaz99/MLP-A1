    "# Template: Fitting and Selecting a Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data\n",
    "- Copy the (mostly) cleaned data from Adrian here \n",
    "- Also make a second copy under a different name in case you save some unintentional changes \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploratory Analysis\n",
    "### Normality\n",
    "#### Checking Normality\n",
    "- Use Shapiro Wilk's Test to verify normality of the variables.\n",
    "- Regression models assume normal distribution, therefore if any variables are non-normal we should exclude them or perform some transformations to make them normal \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Addressing Non-Normality\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Outlier Analysis\n",
    "- Detecting and removing outliers makes data more normal, should however only done with care\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Log Transformation\n",
    "- Log transforms of the data bring in the tails and make data more normal \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking Correlation\n",
    "- Run a standard corrleation matrix across the feature space\n",
    "- Correlated data is fine as long as correlation is not above 0.9\n",
    "- If two features are highly correlated we exclude one or address this in interpretation. Possibly LASSO deals with this automatically as well but good to be aware beforehand\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard Scaling\n",
    "- Definitely good practice to scale continuous variables to mean zero and standard deviation = 1 to bring them on the same scale \n",

    "Typically, there are two ways of going about this:\n",
    "- LASSO Regularization to shrink coefficients to zero\n",
    "- Stepwise Selection\n",
    "    - Backwards Stepwise Selection starts with the full model and sequentially reduces it down until it no longer improves\n",
    "        - Typically produces a larger model\n",
    "    - Forwards Stepwise Selection starts with the null model (only intercept) and sequentially adds features\n",
    "        - Typically produces smaller model than backwards stepwise\n",
